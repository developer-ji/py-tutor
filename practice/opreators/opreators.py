#Opreators in Python

#Arthmetic Opreators:-
# Arithmetic operators are used to performing mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
# a = int(input("enter first num:-"))
# b = int(input("enter second num:-"))
# print("add = ", a+b)
# print("sub = ",a-b)
# print("mul = ",a*b)
# print("div1= ",a/b)
# print("div2=",a//b)
# print("mol = ",a%b)
# print("p   = ",a**b)

# Comparison Operators:-
# Comparison of Relational operators compares the values. It either returns True or False according to the condition.
# a = int(input("enter first num:-"))
# b = int(input("enter second num:-"))

# print("a is greater than b  =", a>b)
# print("a is less than b = ", a<b)
# print("a is equal to b = ", a==b)
# print("a is not equal to b = ", a!=b)
# print("a is greater than equal to b = ", a >= b)
# print ("a is less than equal to b =", a<=b)

# Logical Operators
# Logical operators perform Logical AND, Logical OR, and Logical NOT operations. It is used to combine conditional statements.
# a = True
# b = False
# print(a and b)
# print(a or b)
# print(not a)

#Bitwise Operators
# Bitwise operators act on bits and perform the bit-by-bit operations. These are used to operate on binary numbers.
# a = 10
# b = 5
# print(a&b)
# print(a|b)
# print(a^b)
# print(~a)
# print(a>> 2)
# print(a<<2)

# Assignment Operators 
# Assignment operators are used to assign values to the variables.
a = 10
b = 5
a+=b # a = a+b
print(a)
x = 5
y = 10
x-=y
print(x)

A = 5
B = 5
A*=B
print(A)

x = 5
y = 10
x/=y
print(x)
x = 5
y = 10
x%=y
print(x)
x = 5
y = 10
x//=y
print(x)
x = 5
y = 10
x-=y
print(x)
x = 5
y = 10
x-=y
print(x)
