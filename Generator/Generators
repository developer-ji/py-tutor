# Generator are iterable but with some twist
generator jiski length let's say 10 hai
You run a for loop on that generator for 5 times.
If you run a for loop on the same generator again it will start picking the items from the 6th indexing

## If you run again
```python
x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
gener = (i for x in x)
count = 0
```
```python
## It will print till 5th indexing
for i in gener:
    print(i)
    count += 1
    if count >5 : break
```

```python
## It will start from 6th indexing
for i in gener:
    print(i)
```
```python
## Its going to be empty
for i in gener:
    print(i) 
```
